# 🧠 RAG Pipeline for LLMs

This project implements a **Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that enhances language model responses by grounding them in relevant external documents. It combines a **retriever** (for context) and a **generator** (for response) to answer queries with high accuracy and traceability.

## 🚧 Development Notice

This project is currently under active development.  
💡 **Note:** Some components have been temporarily removed or withheld while resolving development issues. Full code and functionality will be added in upcoming updates.
📅 Expected updates coming soon!

## 🎯 Objective

To build a modular, production-ready RAG system that:
- Retrieves context from a custom document corpus
- Generates accurate, context-aware answers using an LLM
- Is extensible for academic, enterprise, and research use cases

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- **LangChain** – LLM workflow orchestration  
- **OpenAI / Hugging Face Transformers** – LLMs  
- **ChromaDB / FAISS** – Vector-based document retrieval  
- **PyPDF / Text Loader** – Document processing  
- **Streamlit / FastAPI** *(optional)* – UI or API deployment
