# 🧠 Codebase RAG Assistant — AI-Powered Code Explainer
An advanced Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to ingest, index, and query software codebases using large language models.
Explore your own project files with natural language queries — understand, debug, and document your code effortlessly.


---

## 🎯 Objective

- Loads and chunks various code files (`.py`, `.md`, `.json`, etc.)
- Creates semantic vector embeddings for efficient search
- Retrieves relevant code snippets in response to natural language queries
- Uses LLMs to generate detailed, context-aware explanations
- Provides a developer-friendly UI for interactive Q&A on your codebase

---


##🔧 Tech Stack
- LangChain — Orchestrating retriever and generator workflows
- SentenceTransformers — Embedding models for semantic search
- ChromaDB — Efficient vector similarity search and indexing
- Streamlit — Web UI for interactive code queries
- Python — Core programming language

## ▶️ Running the Pipeline (Planned)

```bash
# Example placeholder - to be updated when modules are ready
python pipeline/main.py
```

---

## ▶️ How to Use
1. Prepare your codebase in the data/ folder or point to your own repo

2. Run the loader to ingest and chunk code files into the vector store

3. Start the Streamlit app for an interactive Q&A interface
